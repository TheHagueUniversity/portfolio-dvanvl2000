            <h3>UXD Project Bespoke Design</h3>
            <p>During the first year of my current study we were given a project to work on by Hallmark that let us get acquainted with the designing process of UX. At the same time it taught us the ways and rules of designing for a user and user group. In this project we had to come up with a card personalisation tool and an unwrapping experience, which was based on research data of a user whose data was then merged with another to create a persona.</p>
