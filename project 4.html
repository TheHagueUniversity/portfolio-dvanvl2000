               <h3>My Portfolio Website</h3>
               <p>The whole process of making this portfolio website was a project in itself. During my UXD study, we learned to work with HTML and CSS, after our programming bootcamp. In this class, we had to make a portfolio website as our final project. The result is what you see on this and the other pages.</p>
               <p>During this class, we got taught by getting small challenges every week where we had to apply our just learned skills. I could really use these skills for a job in the future that needs website making or editing. Even though it was my very first time working with HTML/CSS, I am proud of what I can already make after just a few weeks of learning.</p>
               <p> The picture you see on the right is how the coding looks like in the software that I use to code HTML and CSS. The software is called "Notepad++".
