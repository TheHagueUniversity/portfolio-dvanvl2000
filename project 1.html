               <h3>Design Competition: Sustainable City of the Future</h3>
               <p>I worked on a project during high school that had us design a medium sized sustainable city, based on our own (Gouda). In a group of 7 students we worked on making a sustainable city on paper, and in the end had to present and compete against other groups. This project already gave me some insight about designing for a particular situation (a city without fossil fuels and unsafe of floods) and user-group (the people of the city). </p>
