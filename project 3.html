               <h3>Programming Bootcamp</h3>
               <p>This may not be an official project and more of a class, but it felt like a personal project to me. During my UXD study, we followed a programming bootcamp where we got the basics of programming/Java explained to us in just a week(!). Everyday our knowledge of programming grew little by little, and at the end of each day we had to make a small project based on what we learned. We also got to make something creative based on what we wanted, which for me resulted in the picture above. </p>
