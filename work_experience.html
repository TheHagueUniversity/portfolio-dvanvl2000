              <p>I delivered commercial papers in my neighbourhood for three months as my first job.</p>
			  <p>The job required me to ride my bike around my neighbourhood multiple times to deliver all the commercial papers, even through harsh weather. I quickly knew that this was not the job for me as I am not a very "physical work" person. However from this job I did learn what my borders are.</p>

              <p>This is my current job where I work at the bakery department in my local supermarket: Albert Heijn. I bake, package, and sell bread. Next to that I clean the place in the evenings. Talking to frequent customers has helped me in the empathize phase of the design process, and the whole working experience has made me think more about how my workplace could be improved using UXD.</p>
              <p>Learning aspects:</p> 
                  <ul>
